# React Native Easy Grid üêµ

This is NOT-JUST-ANOTHER-GRID-LAYOUT library! We are trying to simply flexbox with easier approach.

## Installation

```
npm install react-native-easy-grid --save
```

## Usage

### Include the components

```
import { Col, Row, Grid } from "react-native-easy-grid";
```

### 1. Two columns (50% and 50%)

```
<Grid>
    <Col></Col>
    <Col></Col>
</Grid>
```

> Note: If you don't assign the size property, it defaults to equal width (or height) with its siblings

### 2. Two rows

```
<Grid>
    <Row></Row>
    <Row></Row>
</Grid>
```


### 3. Two rows (75% and 25%)

```
<Grid>
    <Row size={75}></Row>
    <Row size={25}></Row>
</Grid>
```

This is exactly same as

```
<Grid>
    <Row size={3}></Row>
    <Row size={1}></Row>
</Grid>
```

> Same concept applies to `<Col />`


### 4. Three columns (33.33% each)

```
<Grid>
    <Col></Col>
    <Col></Col>
    <Col></Col>
</Grid>
```


### 5. Three rows (50%, 25% and 25%)

```
<Grid>
    <Row size={2}></Row>
    <Row size={1}></Row>
    <Row size={1}></Row>
</Grid>
```


### 6. Nested Layout or Grid

<table width="100" height="100">
	<tr>
		<td rowspan="2" bgcolor="red" width="50">1</td>
		<td bgcolor="yellow" width="50" height="50">2</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td bgcolor="blue">3</td>
	</tr>
</table>

```
<Grid>
	<Col>1<Col>
	<Col>
		<Row>2</Row>
		<Row>3</Row>
	</Col>
</Grid>
```
